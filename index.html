                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the
                    acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include
                    teaching,
                    training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the
                    guidance
                    of educators; however, learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or
                    informal settings, and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or
                    acts may
                    be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public
                    education system, which fall under the command of the government at three levels: Central, state and
                    local.
                    Under various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory
                    Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children
                    aged 6 to
                    14. The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. Major policy
                    initiatives
                    in Indian education are numerous.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
                    knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved
                    orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation
                    to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned
                    through imitation, formal education developed. Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi (right) in the

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">In ancient India, schools were in the form of Gurukuls. Gurukuls were
                traditional Hindu residential schools of learning; typically the teacher's house or a monastery. During
                the Mughal rule, Madrasahs were introduced in India to educate the children of Muslim parents. British
                records show that indigenous education was widespread in the 18th century, with a school for every
                temple, mosque or village in most regions of the country. The subjects taught included Reading, Writing,
                Arithmetic, Theology, Law, Astronomy, Metaphysics, Ethics, Medical Science and Religion. Under the
                British rule in India, Christian missionaries from England, USA and other countries established
                missionary and boarding schools throughout the country. Later as these schools gained in popularity,
                more were started and some gained prestige. These schools marked the beginning of modern schooling in
                India and the syllabus and calendar they followed became the benchmark for schools in
                modern India.</p>
